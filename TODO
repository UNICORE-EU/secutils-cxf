 - Soap v12 checks are removed/disabled in WSSecHeader

Downstream changes:

 - removed ReliableProxy class (xfire specific, a better(!) solution will be introduced in 
   use-cxfclient)
 
 - to enable the correct SOAP parameter style, one MUST add an annotation to the service endpoint
   interface:
   
   @SOAPBinding(style=Style.DOCUMENT, use=Use.LITERAL, parameterStyle=ParameterStyle.BARE)
   
- also with XMLBeans in/out parameters, it is necessary to add @WebResult and @WebParam annotations
  to ensure correct behaviour, even if this means some redundancy in the interface classes
